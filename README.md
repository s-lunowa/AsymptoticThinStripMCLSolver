## Installation

No installation is necessary.
You can just download or pull the software.
The only requirement is that you have a current version of MATLAB&reg; installed (at least R2019a).
MATLAB&reg; is a product and trademark of MathWorks, Inc., which is available at <http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html>.

## Usage

The file [Model.m](Model.m) contains the model as a class with all routines necessary to simulate the process.
The scripts [solver_constricted.m](solver_constricted.m) and [solver_dynamic.m](solver_dynamic.m)
contain examples of usage for uniform and constricted thin strips with constant and dynamic contact angle model, respectively.
